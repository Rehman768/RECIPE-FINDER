                <p>Chole Bhature is a popular North Indian dish that is loved by many. It is a combination of spicy chickpeas (chole) and deep-fried bread (bhature). The chickpeas are cooked in a flavorful tomato-based gravy with a blend of spices, making it a delicious and hearty meal. The bhature is made from a dough of all-purpose flour, yogurt, and a pinch of baking soda, which is then rolled out and deep-fried until golden and puffed up. This dish is often enjoyed as a breakfast or lunch option and is usually served with pickles, onions, and a side of yogurt. It is a perfect dish for special occasions and gatherings, and its rich flavors and textures make it a favorite among all age groups.</p>
